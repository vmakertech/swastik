  <h4>Hairs and skin</h4>

  <p>
    Human hair has little protective value, even in hirsute (excessively hairy) persons. Eyelashes, eyebrows, and the
    hairs inside the external ears and nostrils have obviously useful functions, and scalp hair may be thick enough to
    provide some protection from the midday Sun. The beard and mustache, though, are embellishments, which establish
    maleness and are likely to be concerned with sexual or social communication; and axillary and pubic hair probably
    form part of scent-disseminating mechanisms. <br><br>

    An important role for hair, however, is its participation in the body’s sensory apparatus. All hair follicles are
    surrounded by sensory nerves, and pressure on the hair shaft is transmitted to these nerves. Other mammals,
    including subhuman primates, have highly specialized sensitive hair follicles around the eyes, lips, and muzzle.
    These produce “tactile” hairs, known as vibrissae or whiskers, which are particularly large in nocturnal mammals.
    The follicles from which these hairs emerge are rich in nerves and are surrounded by a sinus filled with blood.
    Humans are the only animals with no sinus hair follicles; but human hair follicles, particularly those of the face,
    are well supplied with nerves, and human skin is probably more sensitive than that of any other mammal. <br><br>

 
    Hairs are manufactured by follicles. Essentially, these are tubelike pockets of the epidermis that extend through
    most or all of the depth of the skin and enclose a small papilla of dermis in their base. They lie at an angle to
    the skin surface. Two-thirds of the way up is a bulge, and attached to it are wisps of smooth muscle fibre that, on
    contracting, pull the follicle to a more or less perpendicular position. This action also puckers the skin into a
    mound on the surface—a so-called goose pimple. <br><br>

    Exactly as in other mammals, the human hair is formed by division of cells in the region known as the bulb, at the
    base of the follicle. Pigment is incorporated from melanocytes in this region. Human hair follicles also go through
    cycles of activity. After a period of growth, the hair becomes clubbed, rather than cylindrical, in shape. Fibrous
    rootlets anchor the club to the surrounding follicular tissue. While forming the club, the follicle shrivels up, the
    lower part becoming largely dissipated. A resting follicle can be recognized at once by the clubbed hair and by the
    follicle’s short size and unique structure. Follicles remain dormant for variable periods of time. When they become
    active again, they reconstruct a bulb that manufactures a new hair. As the new hair works its way to the surface,
    the club hair is loosened from its moorings and shed.<br><br>


    The activity of the hair follicles in the scalp is not synchronized, so that there is a small but steady molt of
    about 50 to 100 hairs a day from a total of around 150,000 follicles. There is, nevertheless, evidence of seasonal
    fluctuation, with the greatest hair loss in late summer and fall. A follicle may continue its activity for a long
    time, and hairs sometimes grow for several years and attain considerable lengths. Even in the human scalp—where the
    hair follicles are dense and vigorously productive—baldness occurs in a large number of individuals. Baldness is not
    a disease but is a systematic involution of hair follicles, culminating in organs similar to the primitive embryonic
    follicles; the numbers of follicles do not necessarily diminish.<br><br>

    Until late in fetal life there is no line of demarcation between the forehead and scalp. After the fifth month of
    gestation the follicles in the rest of the scalp grow larger, but those of the forehead do not. After birth the
    hairs on the forehead become even smaller and nearly invisible. The hairline of newborn infants is usually
    indistinct; the familial hairline pattern is defined late in childhood through a process that is identical with that
    of baldness. When male-pattern baldness sets in, in the late 20s or earlier, the follicles affected undergo exactly
    the same changes as do those that establish the hairline.<br><br>

    Male-pattern baldness and its female equivalent, which is usually more diffuse, are hereditary conditions. In males
    this type of baldness is believed to arise from defects in the hair stem cells, which are located in the hair bulb
    and eventually mature into progenitor hair cells that then develop into mature hairs. Paradoxically, since male
    hormones (androgens) stimulate the growth of most other hair, this type of baldness occurs only if androgens are
    present.<br><br>


    Hairs vary in colour, diameter, and contour. The different colours result from variations in the amount,
    distribution, and type of melanin pigment in them, as well as from variations in surface structure that cause light
    to be reflected in different ways. Hairs may be coarse or so thin and colourless as to be nearly invisible. Straight
    hairs are round, while wavy hairs are alternately oval and round; very curly and kinky hairs are shaped like twisted
    ribbons.<br><br>

    Human hair grows at the rate of about one-third of a millimetre a day, and once keratinized it is inert. If the
    colour or shape of a hair is altered as it is formed, several days must elapse before the effect becomes visible.
    Hairs become white with aging because of the failure of the melanocytes to inject pigment into the cells as they are
    formed. Tales of hair becoming white overnight may perhaps arise from cases of rapid differential shedding of
    pigmented hairs from a mixed population of white and dark ones, but the suggestion that individual dark hairs can
    somehow rapidly turn white is not true.<br><br>

    The beard and mustache are the most obvious examples of hair that requires male sex hormones, or androgens, for its
    growth. Facial hairs begin to develop at puberty, about two years after the start of pubic hair growth. The rate of
    growth of the beard initially increases with age but levels out after 35. Hair on the chest—a traditional sign of
    masculinity—and that on the limbs are also androgen-dependent. Androgens cause longer hairs to be formed, partly by
    making them grow faster, but mainly by increasing the length of anagen, the growing phase. Fully formed hairs on the
    thigh are over three times longer in young men than in women; and the duration of anagen is around 54 days in males,
    compared with 22 days in females.<br><br>


    Pubic and axillary hair are also dependent on androgens, but they differ from other body hair in that they are
    luxuriant in females as well as in males. Their growth requires lower levels of hormone. The lower triangle of pubic
    hair is present in persons with a rare disease known as male pseudohermaphroditism. These individuals are genetic
    males who remain female in form until puberty because they lack an enzyme necessary to bind two atoms of hydrogen to
    the male hormone testosterone, which is responsible for male sex characteristics. Since persons with male
    pseudohermaphroditism lack facial hair, even when adults, it seems that beard growth requires the conversion of
    testosterone to dihydrotestosterone but that pubic hair growth does not.<br><br>

    <h4>Sebaceous glands</h4>
    The sebaceous glands are usually attached to hair follicles and pour their secretion, sebum, into the follicular
    canal. In a few areas of the body, disproportionately large sebaceous glands are associated with very small hair
    follicles; in other areas there are glands that are altogether free of follicles.<br><br>

    The outstanding feature of sebaceous glands is their holocrine mode of secretion, involving complete disintegration
    of the sebaceous cells. The glands consist of a series of lobes, or acini, each with a duct running toward the main
    sebaceous duct. The cells are generated by cell division around the periphery of each lobe. As they move toward the
    centre of the lobe and toward the duct, they synthesize and accumulate fat globules and become progressively larger
    and distorted. Ultimately they disintegrate to form the secretion.<br><br>


    Human sebum is a complex mixture of lipids—triglyceride fats (57.5 percent), wax esters (26 percent), squalene (12
    percent), cholesterol esters (3 percent), and cholesterol (1.5 percent). The triglycerides are largely hydrolyzed by
    bacteria by the time the sebum reaches the skin surface, so that about a third of the surface fat consists of free
    fatty acids.<br><br>

    The activity of the sebaceous glands is mainly controlled by androgens. The glands are quite large at birth because
    of the influence of maternal hormones during development, but they regress soon afterward. They become active again
    at, or somewhat in advance of, the first signs of puberty. Their rate of secretion is a little higher in adult men
    than in women, and it falls off gradually with age in both sexes. It is very low in eunuchs (castrated males) but
    has been shown to increase when they are treated with androgens. That other factors—for example, pituitary
    hormones—may also influence secretion is suggested by the observation that sebum production is abnormally high in
    acromegaly, a disorder resulting from excessive secretion of growth hormone.<br><br>

    The function of sebum has been greatly debated. Some scientists have theorized that it is important as an emollient
    to prevent too rapid loss of water from the superficial layers of the stratum corneum; others have held that it is a
    functionless product of now useless, or vestigial, organs. Yet humans have more and larger glands than most mammals,
    and there is a specific plan in their distribution: they are largest and most numerous on the face and around the
    anogenital surfaces.<br><br>

    The skin around the nose, mouth, and forehead and over the cheekbones has beds of gigantic glands, the secretion of
    which keeps these surfaces constantly oily. The sebaceous glands evenly spaced in rows at the border of the
    eyelids—the meibomian glands—are so large that they are easily seen with the naked eye when the eyelids are everted.
    The glands on the genitalia produce copious amounts of sebaceous matter called smegma. Only humans have rich
    populations of sebaceous glands on the hairless surfaces of the lips; these glands increase in number and size as
    persons mature. The inside of the cheeks also has many large sebaceous glands, and occasionally there are glands
    even on the gums and tongue. <br><br>
 

    <h4>Sweat glands</h4>
    Sweat glands are coiled tubes of epidermal origin, though they lie in the dermis. Their secretory cells surround a
    central space, or lumen, into which the secretion is extruded. There are two distinct types: eccrine glands open by
    a duct directly onto the skin surface; apocrine glands usually develop in association with hair follicles and open
    into them.<br><br>

    Most other mammals have numerous apocrine glands in the hairy skin; eccrine glands are usually absent from the hairy
    skin and limited to friction surfaces. In nonhuman primates there is a tendency for the number of eccrine sweat
    glands over the body to increase in progressively advanced animals at the same time that the number of apocrine
    glands becomes reduced. Prosimians (primitive primates, such as lemurs, lorises, and tarsiers) have only apocrine
    glands in the hairy skin; eccrine glands begin to appear in some of the higher forms. The great apes either have
    equal numbers or have more eccrine than apocrine glands. Humans have the most eccrine glands, with apocrine glands
    restricted to specific areas.<br><br>

    Strictly speaking, apocrine glands have nothing to do with sweating. They appear late in fetal development (5 to
    51/2 months) nearly everywhere on the body. Most of these rudiments disappear within a few weeks except in the
    external ear canals, in the axillae, on the nipples of the breasts, around the navel, and on the anogenital
    surfaces; single glands may be found anywhere. From this, one might speculate that the ancestors of humans had
    apocrine glands widely distributed over the body, and the embryonic rudiments may be reminders of the history of a
    once widespread organ system.<br><br>

    Where they appear, the apocrine glands are large and numerous. In the axilla they are so large that the coils press
    upon each other, forming adhesions and cross-shunts of such complexity that the glands are more spongy than tubular.
    The complex of these large apocrine glands commingled with an equal number of eccrine sweat glands in the axilla
    composes what is known as the axillary organ, one of the most characteristic features of human skin. Other than
    humans, only chimpanzees and gorillas have axillary organs. In spite of their large size, apocrine glands secrete
    only small amounts of a milky, viscid fluid—pale gray, whitish, yellow, or reddish—which contributes very little to
    axillary sweat. If eccrine glands were not there, the axillae would be relatively dry.<br><br>

    The odour of axillary secretion becomes more intense as it is decomposed by bacteria. Although axillary odours
    frequently seem unpleasant, they are not invariably so. The odour of individual human beings comes mostly from
    apocrine secretion, with some contribution from sebum. Since the body odours of all other animals have a social or
    sexual significance, it can be assumed that this is the archetypal purpose of apocrine secretion, even in humans.
    The view that the axillary organs are scent glands is supported by the finding that androsterones—the compounds that
    are responsible for the odour of the boar to which the sow responds—also occur in human axillary secretions.<br><br>

    Humans have 2,000,000 to 5,000,000 eccrine sweat glands, with an average distribution of 150 to 340 per square
    centimetre. They are most numerous on the palms and soles and then, in decreasing order, on the head, trunk, and
    extremities. Some individuals have more glands than others, but there is no difference in number between men and
    women.<br><br>

    The specific function of sweat glands is to secrete water upon the surface so that it can cool the skin when it
    evaporates. The purpose of the glands on the palms and soles, however, is to keep these surfaces damp, to prevent
    flaking or hardening of the horny layer, and thus to maintain tactile sensibility. A dry hand does not grip well and
    is minimally sensitive.<br><br>

    The eccrine glands, then, can be divided into those that respond to thermal stimulation, the function of which is
    thermoregulation, and those that respond to psychological stimuli and keep friction surfaces moist. This makes a
    clear-cut distinction between the glands on the hairy surfaces and those on the palms and soles. In addition to
    thermal and psychological sweating, some individuals sweat on the face and forehead in response to certain chemical
    substances.<br><br>

    The glands on the palms and soles develop at about 3 1/2 months of gestation, whereas those in the hairy skin are
    the last skin organs to take shape, appearing at five to 5 1/2 months, when all the other structures are already
    formed. This separation of events over time may represent a fundamental difference in the evolutionary history of
    the two types of glands. Those on palms and soles, which appear first and are present in all but the hooved mammals,
    may be more ancient; those in the hairy skin, which respond to thermal stimuli, may be more recent organs.

    <br><br> The sweat glands in the hairy skin of subhuman primates possibly function subliminally, although they are
    structurally similar to those of humans. The skin of monkeys and apes remains dry even in a hot environment. Profuse
    thermal sweating in humans, then, seems to be a new function. Eccrine sweat glands respond to a variety of drugs
    with different properties. They often respond differently in different individuals under nearly identical conditions
    and sometimes even respond inconsistently in the same individual. Notwithstanding these apparent vagaries, the
    eccrine glands function continuously, although their secretion may be imperceptible. Sweating is essential for
    keeping the human body from becoming overheated.<br><br>
