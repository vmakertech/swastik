          <h3 class="text-center p-3"><span style="padding: 5px; border-bottom: 2px dotted gray;">Nadi Pariksha </span>
          </h3>
          <p>Nadi Pariksha is an ancient Ayurvedic technique of
            diagnosis through the pulse. It can accurately diagnose
            physical, mental and emotional imbalances as well as
            diseases, which are addressed through our treatments.
            Nadi Pariksha understands the vibratory frequency of the
            pulse at various levels; which is comprehensive and
            reaches the root cause of health issues and does not just
            addressthe symptoms.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>It can accurately diagnose physical, mental and emotional imbalances as well as diseases.</li>
            <li>Nadi Pariksha understands the vibratory frequency of the pulse at various levels on the Radial Artery.
            </li>
            <li>Subtle vibrations are read at seven different levels vertically downward that help in ascertaining
              various functions in the body.</li>
            <li>The pulse, when examined, reveals both physical and mental characteristics of the patient. This is
              interpreted in the form of symptoms along with their prognosis, which helps in understanding the cause.
              Thus, Nadi Pariksha forms the basis for addressing any ailment in an individual.</li>

          <h4>ABHYANGA (45 mins.) </h4>
          <p>There is no greater expression of self-love than anointing ourselves from head to toe with warm oil—this
            practice is called Abhyanga. A daily Abhyanga practice restores the balance of the doshas and enhances
            well-being and longevity. <br><br>

            The Sanskrit word Sneha can be translated as both “oil” and “love.” It is believed that the effects of
            Abhyanga are similar to those received when one is saturated with love. Like the experience of being loved,
            Abhyanga can give a deep feeling of stability and warmth. <br><br>

            A daily Abhyanga practice restores the balance of the doshas and enhances well-being and longevity. Regular
            Abhyanga is especially grounding and relaxing for Vata dosha imbalances, but everyone can benefit from this
            practice. <br><br>

          <h4>Benefits of Abhyanga</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Nourishes the entire body—decreases the effects of aging</li>
            <li>Imparts muscle tone and vigor to the dhatus (tissues) of the body</li>
            <li>Imparts a firmness to the limbs</li>
            <li>Lubricates the joints</li>
            <li>Increases circulation</li>
            <li>Stimulates the internal organs of the body</li>
            <li>Assists in elimination of impurities from the body</li>
            <li>Moves the lymph, aiding in detoxification</li>
            <li>Increases stamina</li>
            <li>Calms the nerves</li>
            <li>Benefits sleep—better, deeper sleep</li>
            <li>Enhances vision</li>
            <li>Makes hair (scalp) grow luxuriantly, thick, soft and glossy</li>
            <li>Softens and smoothens skin; wrinkles are reduced and disappear</li>
            <li>Pacifies Vata and Pitta and stimulates Kapha</li>
          </ol> <br><br>


          <h4>UZHICHIL (45 mins.) </h4>
          <p>Chavitti uzhichil or Chavutti thirumal is popularly known as foot massage or at times rope massage, based
            on the procedure used in this treatment. This procedure has gathered tremendous interest in the recent years
            owing to the extensive promotions of Chavitti Uzhichil as an exquisite form of treatment. In my Ayurveda
            clinic in Chennai, many of my patients often ask me about this procedure and its origin. This rejuvenation
            treatment is centuries old, with quite an interesting history. Let me tell you the story of Chavitti
            Uzhichil, explaining the procedure, the benefits, and the points to be aware of. <br><br>


          <h4>Swedana (10 mins.) </h4>
          <p>An herbalized steam bath, during which the head and the heart are kept cool (an important
            difference in Ayurvedic steam treatments) while the body is heated to remove mental, emotional and
            physical toxins lodged deeply within the tissues. The cool head and heart provide a sense of calm
            and openness while the therapeutic steam over the entire body can penetrate and cleanse deeply,
            without overheating and causing stress to the body. <br><br>


          <h4>SHIRODHARA (45 mins.)</h4>
          <p>Shirodhara comes from the two Sanskrit words “shiro” (head) and “dhara” (flow). It’s an Ayurvedic healing
            technique that involves having someone pour liquid — usually oil, milk, buttermilk, or water — onto your
            forehead. It’s often combined with a body, scalp, or head massage. <br><br>



          <h4>UDWARTANA (45 mins.)</h4>
          <p>Udwartana is a process in which a paste of herbal powders in water or other suitable liquids is applied on
            the body and is rubbed off gently just as it dries. Udwartana with various powders is effective in reducing
            excessive sweating and bad body odour, in imparting softness and radiance to the skin as well as in reducing
            obesity. The name can be attributed either to the treatments ability to improve the body condition or to the
            upward strokes used in massage here, unlike in other Ayurvedic treatments.<br><br>


          <h4>MARMA (45 mins.) </h4>
          <p>Marma are the vital areas of the body. The word Marma comes from Sanskrit origin word ‘mri’ meaning death.
            The Sanskrit phrase, ‘Marayate Iti Marmani’, also means death or serious damage to body or health after
            infliction to the point of their situation . Hence these areas are called Marma. In siddha system of
            medicine they are called Varma. <br><br>


            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sushruta Samhita describes 107 Marma points in body. In Tamil traditions, 108 Marma
            points are enumarated,
            and in Kalari tradition of kerala 365 Marma points are in practice. Major marma points correspond to seven
            Chakras, or energy centers of the body, while minor points radiate out along the trunk and limbs. The points

          <h4>LEPANA (30 mins.) </h4>

            merely as a method to cure diseases. Our verdant land is blessed in abundance with myriad herbal medicines
            and these have played a crucial role in ensuring the expansion of Ayurveda on our shores. Lepana is a

            musculoskeletal disorders like osteoporosis, tendonitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ligament
            tear, etc.
            <br><br>


          <h4>URO VASTI (30 mins.) </h4>
          <p>AUro Vasti is a localized procedure for treatment of diseases in the region of the chest—especially Kapha
            and Vata Dosha disorders. Essentially, warm, medicated, Dosha-specific oil is kept in contact over the skin
            of the chest region, for a particular amount of time, using a ‘well’ made of a special ,, black gram dough.
            This relaxing therapy has an extremely soothing and healing effect on the skin, muscles, joints, bones and
            underlying organs and structures (especially the lungs, airways and heart). When localized to the
            pericardium region it is called Hrid Vasti.<br><br>


          <h4>GREEVA VASTI (30 mins.) </h4>

            predominates (burning sensations or inflammation), and if vaata is dominant (pain), then treatment is
            performed in the evening. With these factors being considered, Greeva Vasti is generally performed early in
            the morning.<br><br>


          <h4>PINDASWEDA (60 mins.) </h4>
          <p>Pinda Sweda is one of the most important sudation therapies used in Panchakarma. During the treatment,
            various parts of the patient's body are uniformly massaged with a linen bundle called kizhi dipped in a
            special kuzhambu, or medicated oil. The kizhi is usually a fist-sized cloth-wrapped bolus, containing
            Shastika or Navara rice cooked in milk and a herbal mixture. <br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ideally, four practitioners massage simultaneously, two on either side of the patient.
            The patient is made
            to lie in seven or more different positions to ensure that every part of the body is covered. An attendant
            regularly replaces the used kizhis with ones adequately soaked in warm kuzhambu. The oil remaining on the
            body after the procedure is usually removed with palm leaves, and the patient given a bath using herbal
            shampoos. <br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This treatment is prescribed for a variety of ailments, especially for disorders
            related to Vata
            deficiencies.</p><br><br>
