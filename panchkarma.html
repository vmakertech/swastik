            <h1><b>Panchkarma</b></h1>
            <h3>The Ultimate in mind-body healing & Detoxification</h3>
            <p>The Ultimate in Mind-Body Healing & Detoxification Panchakarma is not only for detoxifying the body, but
              also for rejuvenation-strengthening the immune system, and restoring balance and well-being. It is one of
              the most effective healing modalities in Ayurvedic Medicine. It is recommended on a seasonal basis, as
              well as when an individual feels out of balance or is experiencing illness.</p>


            <h1><b>Panchkarma - Rejuvenating detox</b></h1>
            <p>Panchakarma is a Sanskrit word that means "five actions" or "five treatments". This is a process used to
              clean the body of toxic materials left by disease, poor nutrition and environmental toxins. Normally the
              body has the innate ability to efficiently process and remove these waste materials, including the
              vitiated doshas. However, due to one's repeated dietary indiscretions, poor exercise patterns, lifestyle,
              and genetic predisposition, the digestive enzymes, metabolic co-factors, hormones, and agnis which
              regulate the body's internal homeostasis become disorganized. This can lead to the accumulation and spread
              of toxins throughout the physiology resulting in disease. This waste matter is called ama in Ayurveda. Ama
              is a foul-smelling, sticky, harmful substance that needs to be completely evacuated from the body.<br><br>

              Panchakarma will remove the excess doshas and correct imbalances in them as well as eliminate the harmful
              ama out of your system through the body's own organs and channels of elimination (colon, sweat glands,
              lungs, bladder, urinary tract, stomach, intestines, etc). Panchakarma purifies the tissues at a very deep
              level.<br><br>

              It is a very pleasurable experience that is tailored to individual needs and may involve:</p>

            <h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Daily warm oil massage (abhyanga)</li>
                <li>Herbal steam therapy (swedana)</li>
                <li>Lymphatic massage Herbal enemas (basti)</li>
                <li>Nasal administrations (nasya)</li>
                <li>Other special treatments (see treatments below)</li>
              </ul>
            </h3>

            <p>
              Ayurveda recommends Panchakarma as a seasonal treatment for maintaining mental and physical hygiene and
              balance.
              <br><br>
              Panchakarma is a five-fold therapy; it is highly individualized based on the needs of the individual
              depending on the Ayurvedic constitutional type, doshic imbalances, age, digestive strength, immune status,
              and many other factors. Depending on each individual's needs, all or only parts of the five therapies are
              utilized. Specially trained therapists must administer these procedures in an exact sequence for a
              specified period of time. In addition, although Panchakarma is for most part a delightful and comfortable
              therapy, there can be periods of discomfort associated with the profound release of toxins, which does
              occur. It is therefore essential that a knowledgeable expert who can recognize the signs of properly and
              improperly administered Panchakarma supervise the therapy. Fortunately these signs were meticulously
              recorded by the ancient vaidyas.
              <br><br>
              Like all medical procedures, Panchakarma Therapy always must begin with an initial consultation by a
              qualified Ayurvedic Physician who can determine the individual's prakriti (constitutional type), the
              nature of the health problem (if any), and the appropriate degree of intensity of the prescribed
              therapies.
              <br><br>
              Panchakarma treatments have been shown to create measurable brain wave coherence and to lower metabolic
              activity. They allow the body and mind to drop into a profound level of peacefulness. In this state of
              relaxation, it is possible to cleanse toxins from tissues as well as to release deeply held emotional
              tensions.
            </p>

            <h1>Panchakarma Detoxifies the Body and Mind</h1>
            <h4>If we want to experience optimal health, it is crucial to maintain a strong digestive fire and eliminate
              toxins from the body. Panchakarma is a time-proven natural therapy that detoxifies and restores the body's
              inner balance and vitality.</h4>

            <p>According to ayurveda, good health depends upon our capability to fully metabolize all aspects of life,
              assimilating that which nourishes and eliminating the rest. When we can't completely digest our food,
              experiences, and emotions, toxins accumulate in our bodily tissues, creating imbalance and - ultimately -
              disease. Panchakarma is an elegant cleansing process that releases stored toxins and restores the body's
              innate healing ability.<br><br>

              When our digestive energies, known as Agni (fire), are robust, we create healthy tissues, eliminate waste
              products efficiently, and produce a subtle essence called Ojas. Ojas, which may be envisioned as the
              innermost sap of our psychophysiology, is the basis for clarity of perception, physical strength, and
              immunity. On the other hand, if our Agni is weakened, digestion is incomplete and creates toxins that get
              stored in the body. This toxic residue is known as Ama.</p><br>

            <h1>The Foundation for Health and Well-being</h1>
            <p>
              When ama accumulates in the body, it blocks the flow of energy, information, and nourishment throughout
              the system. Ayurveda considers this build-up of toxins the underlying cause of all disease. A common
              example of this is the accumulation of saturated fat and cholesterol that is beyond the body's capacity to
              metabolize. Over time, this leads to the blockage of the blood vessels and arteries and, ultimately, to
              heart attacks.<br><br>

              While it's easy to understand agni and ama in terms of food, it's important to remember that your mind and
              heart are continually digesting energy and information as well. Right now your mental digestive powers are
              working right now to break down these ideas into components that your intellect can assimilate. Similarly,
              your emotional agni is responsible for processing your experince and feelings including the smile of a
              loved one, unexpected criticism at work or the excitement of a new relationship.
            </p>

            <h3>Restoring the Body's Natural Balance</h3>

            <p>If your emotional agni is strong, you are able to extract whatever is nourishing and eliminate the rest.
              The inability to metabolize emotions, however, produces just as much toxic residue as undigested food. In
              fact, pent-up anger, long-held sadness, and lingering guilt are more debilitating for most people than
              problems with physical digestion.</p>


            <h3><b>Panchakarma Treatments</b></h3>

            <p>The descriptions that follow cover the variety of therapies that may be performed during a Panchakarma
              series and represent the actual treatments used in this ancient art of life extension. Two Ayurvedic
              therapists working in synchronicity perform many of them. Two, three, and sometimes four of these
              therapies are linked together during the course of one day's treatments.</p>

                    Marma are the vital areas of the body. The word Marma comes from Sanskrit origin word ‘mri’ meaning death.
                    The Sanskrit phrase, ‘Marayate Iti Marmani’, also means death or serious damage to body or health after
                    infliction to the point of their situation . Hence these areas are called Marma. In siddha system of
                    medicine they are called Varma.
